When a speaker is connected at low impedance the audio does not pass through the transformer in order to maintain a high level of quality. NEO 8 IP is also very simple and quick to install, thanks to the new support designed exclusively for this model, which also allows a quick orientation of the box in both axes.

When a speaker is connected at low impedance the audio does not pass through the transformer in order to maintain a high level of quality. NEO 6 IP is also very simple and quick to install, thanks to the new bracket designed exclusively for this model, which also allows a quick orientation of the box on both axes.

This Structural Mode does not use the winch to lift the load, but involves lifting the load with the help of a manual or electric hoist. That is, the tower is used as a structure that is all locked to the required working height. Once the tower is raised to this desired height, the load must be raised with the hoist. The Structural Mode performs improved loading capactities.",
