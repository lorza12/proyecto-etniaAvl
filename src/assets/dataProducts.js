When a speaker is connected at low impedance the audio does not pass through the transformer in order to maintain a high level of quality. NEO 8 IP is also very simple and quick to install, thanks to the new support designed exclusively for this model, which also allows a quick orientation of the box in both axes.

      "The WTS Series means a change of concept within the front load towers, as it introduces the new Structural Mode. This Structural Mode does not use the winch to lift the load, but involves lifting the load with the help of a manual or electric hoist. That is, the tower is used as a structure that is all locked to the required working height. Once the tower is raised to this desired height, the load must be raised with the hoist. The Structural Mode performs improved loading capactities.",
    description2:
      "Dynamic Overlap is an innovative solution that increases the resistance of the towers and reduces their deflection, making that each tower section overlaps with the previous one at different distances, as with trees in nature. This means that all efforts are concentrated in the same way in all the sections of the tower. Thanks to this, the tower can withstand greater efforts with less deflection.",
